web2admin
=========

This is a simple [web2py](http://www.web2py.com) administration plugin.

It is minimal yet functional using the features provided by web2py SQLFORM.smartgrid.

It takes security very seriously and uses both groups and permissions for fine-grained access control.

Installation
------------
 - Download the [plugin installer](https://github.com/downloads/rif/web2admin/web2py.plugin.web2admin.w2p) and install it via the web2py interface.
 
or
  
 - Clone the web2admin repo and copy content in your app excluding the .git and .gitignore. 

 The master branch will always contain to the latest stable version
 (the development will be done on another branch).
 
Update
------
Just use any of the installation procedures and overwrite the plugin content in your web2py app. 

Usage
-----
Install the plugin ;)

- If a user is in the w2a_root group then it has full rights including adding permissions or changing the groups of other users.

- If a user is in the w2a_manager group then it has all permissions for all tables except auth tables (no changing permissions for other users).

Give fine-grained permissions to particular users for specific tables:
 - Create the following permissions (w2a_read, w2a_create, w2a_select, w2a_edit, w2a_delete, w2a_export) for the desired tables and authorized users. If a user is in w2a_root group it has a special controller (permissions) for adding/removing permissions to the users (you can still perform this through regular appadmin).

Configuration
-------------

Paste the following configuration lines in your model file
(e.g. db.py) to change web2admin behavior:

Change the logo (brand) of the admin app	
   plugins.web2admin.logo = 'SuperApp'  
   plugins.web2admin.logo = IMG(_src=URL('static', 'images/google-buzz.png')) + ' SupperApp'

Configure the number of items per page:

    plugins.web2admin.items_per_page = 5 (default 20)

Add extra links in sidebar:

    plugins.web2admin.custom_sidebar_title = "My Links"
    plugins.web2admin.custom_sidebar_links = [
        A('External link', _href='http://www.youhe.ro', _target='_blank'),
        A('Back to homepage', _href=URL('default', 'index', args=0)),
    ]

Fields
------

You can restrict the fields to be displayed for specific tables by setting the plugins.web2admin.fields to a dictionary of table names and list of fields from those tables:

	plugins.web2admin.fields={
		'test': [db.test.id, db.test.name],
		'student':[db.student.id, db.student.first_name]
	}

Actions
-------

![Actions](http://cloud.github.com/downloads/rif/web2admin/actions.jpg)

Actions can be executed on multiple items by checking them and selecting an action from the header.

By default there are two actions defined: delete and clone.

To define a new action you must create a function that take as arguments a table name and a list of ids, and set the plugins.web2admin.actions plugin parameter to a dictionary having as keys the action names and as values the action functions: 

	def hello_action(table, ids):
		if table != 'student':
		    session.flash = 'Not available'
		else:
		    session.flash = '%s, %s' %(table, ids)

	plugins.web2admin.actions = {'hello': hello_action}

If you want to disable the default actions or you want no actions at all (if you did not create any), you can set the plugins.web2admin.default_actions parameter to an empty dictionary.
 
	plugins.web2admin.default_actions={}
